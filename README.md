### Hi there 👋

- 👨🏾‍💻 I'm an HTML/CSS Developer, working my way through a bootcamp focused on software engineering. I'm skilled in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Git, and GitHub, and am currently learning React.js, NPM, Webpack, Babel, Rest API, Node.js, Google Cloud, and MondoDB.
- I'm interested in building websites and apps to solve practical human relationship problems. 

⚡ Fun fact: There's a supermassive black hole at the heart of every galaxy.
